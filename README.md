# Data-Analysis-Dashboard

## Objective
This project aims to analyze data and visualize key insights using an Excel Dashboard. The report provides meaningful insights, key performance indicators (KPIs), and interactive charts to support data-driven decision-making.

## DESCRIPTION
This repository contains an Excel-based dashboard designed for data analysis.
It includes: 

-Interactive charts and visualizations  
-Automated data calculations  
-Key insights extracted from the dataset  
-Custom formatting for enhanced readability
-Data transformation using Power Query
-Pivot Tables for summarizing data
-Dashboard visualization for clear and effective insights


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

-Patient Admission Status: Displays the number of patients admitted vs. not admitted.

-Patient Age Distribution: Groups patients by age.

-Patient Satisfaction Score: Tracks the average daily satisfaction score to assess service quality. Uses an area sparkline to show trends and identify drops linked to busy times or challenges.

-Timeliness: Measures the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.

-Gender Analysis: Displays the number of patients by gender.

-Department Referrals: Identifies the most frequently referred departments.

-Number of Patients: Counts total daily ER visits and shows trends using an area sparkline to spot patterns like peak days or seasonal fluctuations.

-Average Wait Time: Calculates the average time patients wait to see a medical professional. Uses an area sparkline to track changes and highlight days requiring improvements.


## Tools & Technologies Used

-Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting)

-Data Cleaning & Transformation using Excel formulas

-Dashboard UI Design with Excel visual elements

## Project Insights
-Total Patients & Admissions: 
The dashboard reports 479 patients for the selected month.
50.52% of patients were not admitted, while 49.48% were admitted.

-Wait Time & Satisfaction:
The average wait time for patients was 34.90 minutes.
The patient satisfaction score was 5.30, indicating room for service improvements.

-Admission Timeliness:
58% of patients were seen on time, while 42% experienced delays.

-Demographics & Age Distribution:
The largest age group seeking medical attention was 15-29 years (102 patients).
Younger children (0-4 years) had the lowest patient count (29 patients).

-Gender Ratio:
51% of patients were female, while 49% were male.

-Department Referrals:
The top three most visited departments were:
General Practice (874 patients)
Orthopedics (463 patients)
Physiotherapy (134 patients)

-Patients Without a Specific Department:
A significant number (2,514 patients) did not require a specialist referral, indicating a high volume of general medical consultations.

## Conclusions
-Operational Efficiency Needs Improvement: With 42% of patients facing delays, optimizing staff allocation and scheduling may improve service timeliness. 

-Young Adults Seek More Medical Attention: The 15-29 age group is the most frequent visitor, possibly due to lifestyle-related concerns.

-Patient Satisfaction Can Be Enhanced: A score of 5.30 suggests mixed patient experiences, and addressing bottlenecks in wait times could improve this.

-General Practice Handles the Most Cases: Efforts should be made to optimize the workflow in this department to manage high patient volumes.
